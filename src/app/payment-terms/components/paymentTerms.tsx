        <h2>1. Your use of the Payment Services</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>1.1 Bidyourstay Payment Services.</strong> By using the
          Payments Services, you agree to comply with these Payments Terms.
          Bidyourstay Payments may temporarily limit or suspend your access to
          or use of the Payment Services, or its features, to carry out
          maintenance measures that ensure the proper functioning of the Payment
          Services. Bidyourstay Payments may improve, enhance and modify the
          Payment Services and introduce new Payment Services from time to time.
          Bidyourstay Payments will provide notice to Members of any changes to
          the Payment Services, unless such changes do not materially increase
          the Members’ contractual obligations or decrease the Members’ rights
          under these Payments Terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>1.2 Third Party Services.</strong> The Payment Services may
          contain links to third-party websites or resources (“Third-Party
          Services”). Such Third-Party Services are subject to different terms
          of service and privacy policies, and Members should review them.
          Bidyourstay Payments is not responsible or liable for the use of such
          Third-Party Services. Links to any Third-Party Services are not an
          endorsement by Bidyourstay Payments of those Third-Party Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>1.3 Your Bidyourstay Account.</strong> Bidyourstay Payments
          may enable features that allow you to authorize other Members or third
          parties to take certain actions that affect your Bidyourstay account.
          You may authorize a third party to use your Bidyourstay account if the
          feature is enabled for your Bidyourstay account. You acknowledge and
          agree that anyone you authorize to use your Bidyourstay account may
          use the Payment Services on your behalf and that you will be
          responsible for any payments made by such person.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong> 1.4 Identification and Verification.</strong> You authorize
          Bidyourstay Payments, directly or through third parties, to make any
          inquiries we consider necessary to verify your identity and
          information you provide, and if applicable, verifying the identity of
          the representative(s) and beneficial owner(s). This may include
          <br />
          (i) screening you and, if applicable, your representative(s) and
          beneficial owner(s) against third-party databases or other sources,
          <br />
          (ii) requesting reports from service providers,
          <br />
          (iii) asking you and, if applicable, your representative(s) and
          beneficial owner(s) to provide a form of government identification
          (e.g., driver’s license or passport) to check your name, place and
          date of birth, your address, nationality and/or other information
          which we deem necessary under applicable laws; or
          <br />
          (iv) requiring you to take steps to confirm ownership of your email
          address, Payment Method(s) or Payout Method(s). Bidyourstay Payments
          reserves the right to terminate, suspend, or limit access to the
          Payment Services in the event we are unable to obtain or verify any of
          this information.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>1.5 Additional Terms.</strong> Your access to or use of
          certain Payment Services may be subject to, or require you to accept,
          additional terms and conditions. If there is a conflict between these
          Payments Terms and terms and conditions applicable to a specific
          Payment Service, the latter terms and conditions will take precedence
          with respect to your use of or access to that Payment Service, unless
          specified otherwise.

        <h2>2. Guest Terms</h2>

        <span>
          <p>
            2.1 Adding a Payment Method. When you add a Payment Method to your
            Bidyourstay account, you will be asked to provide billing
            information such as name, billing address, and financial instrument
            information either to Bidyourstay Payments or its third-party
            payment processor(s). You authorize Bidyourstay Payments and its
            payment service providers to collect and store your Payment Method
            information.
          </p>
          <p>
            2.2 Payment Method Verification. When you add or use a new Payment
            Method, Bidyourstay Payments may verify the Payment Method by (i)
            authorizing your Payment Method for one or two nominal amounts via a
            payment service provider, and asking you to confirm those amounts,
            or (ii) requiring you to upload a billing statement. We may, and
            retain the right to, initiate refunds of these amounts from your
            Payment Method. When you add a Payment Method during checkout, we
            will automatically save and add that Payment Method to your
            Bidyourstay account so it can be used for a future transaction. You
            may not remove the Payment Method associated with a reservation
            during the period commencing from the date of your booking and
            ending fourteen (14) days following your check-out date, nor during
            any additional period of time needed to resolve any outstanding
            Damage Claim associated with such booking.
          </p>
          <p>
            2.3 Payment Authorization. You allow Bidyourstay Payments to charge
            your Payment Method (including charging more than one Payment
            Method), either directly or indirectly, for all fees due (including
            any applicable taxes) in connection with your Bidyourstay account,
            including Damage Claim amounts in accordance with the Terms and with
            Section 6. When you pay using your bank account, you authorize
            Bidyourstay Payments to debit your bank account according to the
            payment schedule shown at checkout. You also authorize Bidyourstay
            Payments to further debit or credit your bank account to correct any
            erroneous debit, make necessary adjustments to your payment, or to
            issue a refund back to your bank account.
          </p>
          <p>
            2.4 Automatic Update of Payment Method. If your Payment Method’s
            account information changes (e.g., account number, routing number,
            expiration date) as a result of re-issuance or otherwise, we may
            acquire that information from our financial services partners or
            your bank and automatically update your Payment Method on file.
          </p>
          <p>
            2.5 Timing of Payment. Bidyourstay Payments generally charges the
            Total Price due after the Host accepts your booking request.
            However, if you pay with a push Payment Method (such as Sofort),
            Bidyourstay Payments will collect the Total Price due at the time of
            your booking request or after the Host accepts your booking request.
            Bidyourstay may offer alternative options for the timing and manner
            of payment. Any additional fees for using those alternative payment
            options will be displayed via the Bidyourstay Platform and included
            in the Total Price, and you agree to pay such fees by selecting the
            payment option. Additional terms and conditions may apply for the
            use of an alternative payment option. If Bidyourstay Payments is
            unable to collect the Total Price due, as scheduled, Bidyourstay
            Payments will collect the Total Price due at a later point in
            accordance with Section 5.3. Once the payment for your requested
            booking is successfully completed, you will receive a confirmation
            email.
          </p>
          <p>
            2.6 Currency.
            <br />
            2.6.1 The currencies available to make payments may be limited for
            regulatory or operational reasons based on factors such as your
            selected Payment Method, your country of residence, and/or your
            Bidyourstay Payments contracting entity(ies). Any such limitations
            will be communicated via the Bidyourstay Platform, and you will be
            prompted to select a different currency or Payment Method if your
            preferred currency is not available.
            <br />
            2.6.2 Note that if the country in which your Bidyourstay Payments
            contracting entity is located is different than the country of your
            Payment Method provider, or your selected currency is different than
            your Payment Method&apos;s billing currency, your payment may be
            processed outside of your country of residence. As a result, your
            Payment Method provider may impose certain fees and the amount
            listed on your Payment Method statement may be different from the
            amount shown at checkout. For example, if you make a booking using a
            U.S. issued card, but select Euro as your currency, your payment may
            be processed outside the U.S., and banks and credit card companies
            may impose international transaction fees and foreign exchange fees.
            In addition, if you select to pay with a currency that is different
            than your Payment Method&apos;s billing currency, your bank or
            credit card company may convert the payment amount to your billing
            currency associated with your Payment Method, based on an exchange
            rate and fee amount determined solely by your bank. Bidyourstay
            Payments is not responsible for any such fees and disclaims all
            liability in this regard. Please contact your Payment Method
            provider if you have any questions about these fees or any exchange
            rate imposed by your Payment Method provider.
          </p>
          <p>
            2.7 Booking Request Status. If a requested booking is declined
            because it is not accepted by the Host, you cancel the booking
            request before it is accepted by the Host, or Bidyourstay cancels
            the booking, any amounts collected by Bidyourstay Payments and due
            to you pursuant to the policies described in Section 5.5, will be
            refunded to you, and any pre-authorization of your Payment Method
            will be released (if applicable) in accordance with Section 5.5.2
          </p>
          <p>
            2.8 Payment Restrictions. Bidyourstay Payments reserves the right to
            decline or limit payments that we believe (i) may violate
            Bidyourstay Payments’ risk management policies or procedures, (ii)
            may violate these Payments Terms or the Terms, (iii) are
            unauthorized, fraudulent or illegal; or (iv) expose you,
            Bidyourstay, Bidyourstay Payments, or others to risks unacceptable
            to Bidyourstay Payments.
          </p>
          <p>
            2.9 Payment Service Providers. Payment Methods may involve the use
            of third-party payment service providers. These payment service
            providers may charge you additional fees when processing payments in
            connection with the Payment Services, and Bidyourstay Payments is
            not responsible for any such fees and disclaims all liability in
            this regard. Your Payment Method may also be subject to additional
            terms of use. Please review them before using your Payment Method.
          </p>
          <p>
            2.10 Your Payment Method, Your Responsibility. Bidyourstay Payments
            is not responsible for any loss suffered by you as a result of
            incorrect Payment Method information provided by you.
          </p>

            <strong>2.11 Different Ways to Pay</strong>
            <br />
            <strong>2.11.1 Pay part now, part later</strong>
            <br />
            2.11.1.1
            <p>
              Bidyourstay may make available to Guests the option to pay a
              portion of the booking’s Total Price at the time of booking and
              pay the remainder of the Total Price at a later time prior to
              check-in (“Pay part now, part later”). Availability of this option
              may depend on the Listing and/or Payment Method.
              <br />
              2.11.1.2 If you choose Pay part now, part later, the Bidyourstay
              Platform will notify you during check out of the amount, currency
              and schedule of each payment due. On the following payments due
              date, Bidyourstay Payments will automatically charge the original
              Payment Method you used to make the booking.
              <br />
              2.11.1.3 If you make a modification to a booking made with Pay
              part now, part later, Bidyourstay will notify you of the revised
              payment schedule, as applicable, and Bidyourstay Payments will
              automatically charge the original Payment Method you used to make
              the booking on the revised payment due dates. If the modification
              increases your Total Price, you may be required to make an
              additional partial payment of the new Total Price at the time of
              the modification.
              <br />
              2.11.1.4 You agree that by selecting a Pay part now, part later,
              you may not be able to pay for the booking with a different
              Payment Method or pursuant to a different payment schedule.
              <br />
              2.11.1.5 If Bidyourstay Payments is unable to collect your
              payment, Bidyourstay Payments will notify you of such declined
              payment, and require you to complete the payment using an
              alternative Payment Method within 72 hours of the notice. If you
              fail to complete the payment, you authorize Bidyourstay to cancel
              the booking on your behalf. If the booking is canceled, you will
              be refunded based on the Host’s cancellation policy.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>2.11.2 Recurring Payments</strong>
              <br />
              2.11.2.1 For certain bookings (such as for Accommodation bookings
              of twenty-eight (28) nights or more), Bidyourstay Payments may
              require a Guest to make recurring, incremental payments toward the
              Total Price owed (“Recurring Payments”). More information on
              Recurring Payments (including the amount and the frequency of
              payments) will be made available via the Bidyourstay Platform if
              applicable to a booking.
              <br /> 2.11.2.2 If Recurring Payments apply to a confirmed
              booking, then the Guest authorizes Bidyourstay Payments to collect
              the Total Price due.
              <br />
              2.11.2.3 Guests may stop a Recurring Payment by notifying
              Bidyourstay Payments orally or in writing at least three (3)
              business days before the scheduled date of the payment.
              Bidyourstay Payments may require you to give written confirmation
              of a stop-payment order within fourteen (14) days of an oral
              notification. If you fail to provide written confirmation within
              those fourteen (14) days, Bidyourstay Payments is not obligated to
              honor your request to stop any future Recurring Payments. If you
              have any questions regarding your Recurring Payments, please
              contact Bidyourstay Payments.

        <h2>3. Host Terms</h2>
        <span>
          <p>
            3.1 Payment Collection. Bidyourstay Payments generally collects the
            Total Price of a booking at the time the Guest’s booking request is
            accepted by the Host, unless noted otherwise.
          </p>
          <p>
            3.2 Valid Payout Method. In order to receive a Payout you must have
            a valid Payout Method linked to your Bidyourstay account. When you
            add a Payout Method to your Bidyourstay account, you will be asked
            to provide information such as name, government identification, tax
            ID, billing address, and financial instrument information either to
            Bidyourstay Payments or its third-party payment processor(s).
            Depending on the Payout Method selected additional information may
            be required, such as: residential address, name on the account,
            account type, routing number, account number, email address, payout
            currency, identification number and account information associated
            with a particular payment processor. Providing requested information
            is required for a Payout Method to be valid. The information
            Bidyourstay Payments requires for a valid Payout Method may change,
            and Bidyourstay Payments may request additional information at any
            time; failing to provide requested information may result in
            Bidyourstay Payments temporarily placing a hold, suspending, or
            canceling any Payout until the information is provided and, if
            necessary, validated. You authorize Bidyourstay Payments to collect
            and store your Payout Method information in accordance with
            Bidyourstay’s Privacy Policy. Bidyourstay Payments may also share
            your information with governmental authorities as required by
            applicable law.

            <strong>3.3 Timing of Payout</strong>
            <br />
            3.3.1 Subject to and conditional upon successful receipt of the
            payments from Guest, Bidyourstay Payments will generally initiate
            Payouts to your selected Payout Method: (i) for Accommodations, 24
            hours after the Guest’s scheduled check-in time (or 24 hours after
            3:00 pm local time - or 3:00 pm IST if local time is unknown - if
            the check-in time is flexible or not specified); (ii) for
            Experiences, 24 hours after the start of the Experience; and (iii)
            for all other Host Services, at the time specified via the
            Bidyourstay Platform. For Accommodation bookings of twenty-eight
            (28) nights or more, Bidyourstay Payments will generally initiate
            the first payout 24 hours after the Guest’s scheduled check-in time,
            and will initiate future payouts every 30 days after the initial
            payout, for the duration of the reservation.
            <br />
            3.3.2 Bidyourstay Payments may offer you a different Payout time or
            trigger for payment, which may be subject to additional terms and
            conditions. The time it takes to receive Payouts once released by
            Bidyourstay Payments may depend upon the Payout Method you select.
          </p>
          <p>
            3.4 Payout. Your Payout for a booking will be the Total Price less
            applicable fees like Bidyourstay service fees and applicable taxes,
            and any amounts you agree to allocate to any co-host, or the
            owner(s) of an Accommodation, a homeowners’ association, and/or
            their agent (such as a building operator or property management
            company). In the event of cancellation of a confirmed booking,
            Bidyourstay Payments will remit the amount you are due (if any) as
            provided in the Terms and applicable cancellation policy.
          </p>

          <p>
            3.5 Payout Restrictions. Bidyourstay Payments may temporarily place
            a hold, suspend, or cancel any Payout for purposes of preventing
            unlawful activity or fraud, risk assessment, security, or completing
            an investigation; or if we are unable to verify your identity, or to
            obtain or verify requested information. Furthermore, Bidyourstay
            Payments may temporarily place a hold on, suspend, or delay
            initiating or processing any Payout due to you under the Terms as a
            result of high volume Booking cancellations or modifications arising
            from a Force Majeure Event (as defined below).
          </p>
          <p>
            3.6 Payout Currency. Bidyourstay Payments will remit your Payouts in
            the currency you select via the Bidyourstay Platform. The currencies
            available may be limited for regulatory or operational reasons based
            on factors such as your selected Payout Method, your country of
            residence, and/or your Bidyourstay contracting entity(ies). Any such
            limitations will be communicated via the Bidyourstay Platform, and
            you will be prompted to select a different currency or Payout
            Method. Note that payment service providers may impose transaction,
            currency conversion or other fees based on the currency or Payout
            Method you select, and Bidyourstay Payments is not responsible for
            any such fees and disclaims all liability in this regard.
          </p>
          <p>
            3.7 Limits on Payouts. For compliance or operational reasons,
            Bidyourstay Payments may limit the amount of a Payout. If you are
            due an amount above that limit, Bidyourstay Payments may make a
            series of Payouts (potentially over multiple days) in order to
            provide your full Payout amount.
          </p>
          <p>
            3.8 Payment Service Providers. Payout Methods may involve the use of
            third-party payment service providers. These payment service
            providers may charge you additional fees when processing Payouts in
            connection with the Payment Services (including deducting charges
            from the Payout amount), and Bidyourstay Payments is not responsible
            for any such fees and disclaims all liability in this regard. Your
            Payout Method may also be subject to additional terms of use from
            such third-party payment service providers. Please review them
            before using your Payout Method.
          </p>
          <p>
            3.9 Handling of Funds. Bidyourstay Payments may combine amounts that
            it collects from Guests and invest them as permitted under
            applicable laws. Bidyourstay Payments will retain any interest it
            earns on those investments.
          </p>
          <span>
            3.10 Your Payout Method, Your Responsibility. Bidyourstay Payments
            is not responsible for any loss suffered by you as a result of
            incorrect Payout Method information provided by you.

                <br />
                3.11.1 Split Payouts
                <br />
                If you provide Host Services jointly with one or more other
                Hosts as part of a team, business or other organization (“Host
                Team”), Bidyourstay may make available to such Hosts the option
                to allocate between the members of the Host Team the total Host
                Payout for a booking. Bidyourstay Payments will execute such
                payments at the instruction of one or more members of the Host
                Team and is not responsible for any losses related to errors or
                omissions made by the Hosts in providing such payment
                instructions.

          4. Appointment of Bidyourstay Payments as Limited Payment Collection
          Agent
        </h2>

        <p>
          4.1 Each Host, including each Host Team member, hereby appoints
          Bidyourstay Payments as the Host’s payment collection agent solely for
          the limited purpose of accepting and processing funds from Guests
          purchasing Host Services on the Host’s behalf.
        </p>

        <p>
          4.2 Each Host, including each Host Team member, agrees that payment
          made by a Guest through Bidyourstay Payments, shall be considered the
          same as a payment made directly to the Host, and the Host will provide
          the Host Service booked by the Guest in the agreed-upon manner as if
          the Host has received the payment directly from the Guest. Each Host
          agrees that Bidyourstay Payments may refund the Guest in accordance
          with the Terms. Each Host understands that Bidyourstay Payments’
          obligation to pay the Host is subject to and conditional upon
          successful receipt of the associated payments from Guest. Bidyourstay
          Payments guarantees payments to Host(s) only for such amounts that
          have been successfully received by Bidyourstay Payments from Guests in
          accordance with these Payments Terms. In accepting appointment as the
          limited payment collection agent of the Host, Bidyourstay Payments
          assumes no liability for any acts or omissions of the Host.
        </p>
        <p>
          4.3 Each Guest acknowledges and agrees that, notwithstanding the fact
          that Bidyourstay Payments is not a party to the agreement between you
          and the Host(s), including each Host Team member, Bidyourstay Payments
          acts as each Host’s payment collection agent for the limited purpose
          of accepting payments from you on behalf of the Host(s). Upon a
          Guest’s payment of the funds to Bidyourstay Payments, the Guest’s
          payment obligation to the Host(s) for the agreed upon amount is
          extinguished, and Bidyourstay Payments is responsible for remitting
          the funds successfully received by Bidyourstay Payments to the Host(s)
          in the manner described in these Payments Terms. In the event that
          Bidyourstay Payments does not complete the provision of the Payment
          Services and remit any such amounts, the Host(s) will have recourse
          only against Bidyourstay Payments and not the Guest directly for the
          failure on the provision of the Payment Services.

          5.1 Fees. Bidyourstay Payments may charge fees for use of certain

          the Terms or via the Bidyourstay Platform.
        </p>
        <span>
          5.2 Payment Authorizations. You authorize Bidyourstay Payments to
          collect from you amounts due pursuant to these Payment Terms and/or
          the Terms by either (i) charging or debiting the Payment Method
          associated with the relevant booking, or any other Payment Method on
          file that you authorize in your Bidyourstay account (unless you have
          previously removed the authorization to charge or debit such Payment
          Method(s)), or (ii) by withholding the amount from your future Payout.
          Specifically, you authorize Bidyourstay Payments to collect from you:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Any amount due to Bidyourstay or Bidyourstay Payments (e.g., as a
              result of your bookings, Booking Modifications, cancellations, or
              other actions as a Guest, Host or user of the Bidyourstay
              Platform), including reimbursement for costs prepaid by
              Bidyourstay or Bidyourstay Payments on your behalf. Any funds
              collected by Bidyourstay Payments will deduct the amount owed by
              you to Bidyourstay or Bidyourstay Payments and extinguish your
              obligation to Bidyourstay or Bidyourstay Payments.
            </li>
            <li>
              Any amount due to a Host from a Guest which Bidyourstay collects
              as the Host’s payment collection agent as further set out in
              Section 4 above.

            <li>Taxes, where applicable and as set out in the Terms.</li>
            <li>
              Any amount you pay through the Resolution Center in connection
              with your Bidyourstay account.
            </li>
            <li>
              Any Damage Claim amounts owed to Bidyourstay or Bidyourstay

            <li>
              Overstay penalties payable under the Terms, including any cost and
              expenses incurred in collecting the overstay penalty.
            </li>
            <li>
              Any service fees or cancellation fees imposed pursuant to the
              Terms (e.g., if, as a Host, you cancel a confirmed booking).
            </li>
            <li>
              Any amounts already paid to you as a Host despite a Guest
              canceling a confirmed booking or Bidyourstay deciding that it is
              necessary to cancel a booking in accordance with the Terms, or
              other applicable cancellation policy. You agree that in the event
              you have already been paid, Bidyourstay Payments will be entitled
              to recover the amount of any such guest refund from you, including
              by subtracting such refund amount out from any future Payouts due
              to you.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </span>
        <p>
          If you owe an amount at any time after a booking, such as with Payment
          Plan or Recurring Payment charges, Booking Modifications, resolution
          center payments, or Damage Claims (“Additional Amounts”), you
          authorize Bidyourstay Payments to collect payments for such Additional
          Amounts by charging your Payment Method associated with the relevant
          booking without any further action on your part. Bidyourstay Payments
          will notify you in writing before any Additional Amounts are charged.
          If your Payment Method associated with the relevant booking is
          determined to be expired, invalid or otherwise not able to be charged
          for any reason (such as insufficient funds), you remain responsible
          for any uncollected amounts. You authorize Bidyourstay Payments to
          charge or debit the Payment Method related to your booking again or
          use any other Payment Method on file associated with your Bidyourstay
          account, if available, to collect such Additional Amounts. Your bank
          may charge you an overdraft or other fees for each payment failure.
          Any amount not collected for any reason will be subject to any
          remedies that may be available, including, but not limited to,
          referral to a collections agency, or pursuit of available causes of
          action or claims against you. If Bidyourstay has reason to believe
          that you as a Host participated in fraudulent activity, such as an
          overpayment scam, booking fraud or other fraud, and Bidyourstay
          Payments released the payout for such stay, Bidyourstay Payments may
          recoup from you such amount by reducing, deducting or debiting the
          amount from any future Payouts owed to you. In addition to any amount
          due as outlined above, if there are delinquent amounts or chargebacks
          associated with your Payment Method, you may be charged fees that are
          incidental to Bidyourstay Payments collection of these delinquent
          amounts and chargebacks. Such fees or charges may include collection
          fees, convenience fees or other third-party charges.

          Payouts, two hundred and seventy (270) days have elapsed after the

          <br />
          5.3.3 Bidyourstay Payments will deem any overdue amounts not collected
          to be in default when three hundred and sixty five (365) days have
          elapsed: (a) for authorized charges or debits, after Bidyourstay
          Payments first attempts to charge or debit your Payment Method or the
          associated services have been provided, whichever is later; and (b)
          for withholdings from a Host’s future Payouts, after the adjustment is

          <br />
          5.4.1 Bidyourstay Payments will take the necessary steps to rectify
          any payment processing errors that we become aware of. These steps may
          include crediting or debiting (as appropriate) the original Payout
          Method or Payment Method used or selected by you, so that you end up
          receiving or paying the correct amount. This may be performed by
          Bidyourstay Payments or a third party such as your financial
          institution. We may also take steps to recover funds sent to you in
          error (including but not limited to an event of duplicate payments
          made to you due to a processing error), by reducing, deducting and/or
          debiting the amount of such funds from any future Payouts owed to you.
          <br />
          5.4.2 To the extent you receive any funds in error, you agree to
          immediately return such funds to Bidyourstay Payments.

          <br />
          5.5.2 Subject to this Section 5.5.2, Bidyourstay Payments will

          until the Guest is either refunded or the Guest directs Bidyourstay to
          use the funds to rebook with another Host. In certain instances, the
          refund process may include the option to receive credit in lieu of a
          cash refund; if this option is made available to you, the timing of
          your refund will be communicated via the Bidyourstay Platform. The
          time it takes to receive any cash refund or for any pre-authorization
          of your Payment Method to be released will vary based on the Payment
          Method and any applicable payment system (e.g., Visa, Mastercard,
          etc.) rules. In the event of a Force Majeure Event that may affect the
          processing and settlement of refunds, Bidyourstay Payments will
          initiate and process the refund as soon as is practicable.

          approved payment request under the Host Damage Protection or Japan

          17.2 Diverted Payouts and Complaints <br />
          17.2.1 If you as a Host believe or become aware that a Payout properly
          due to you has been or may be diverted without your authorization
          (“Diverted Payout”) because your password or other credentials to log
          into your Bidyourstay account (“Credentials”) have been lost or stolen
          or misappropriated, you should notify Bidyourstay Payments India
          without undue delay on becoming aware of the loss, theft, or
          misappropriation of your Credentials or of the unauthorized use of
          your Credentials or access to your Bidyourstay account. <br />
          17.2.2 If you as Host claim not to have received a Payout properly due
          to you via your chosen Payout Method (including where there has been a
          Diverted Payout), Bidyourstay Payments India will (if requested by you
          without undue delay, on becoming aware of the unauthorised or
          incorrectly executed Payout and in any event within 13 months of it
          happening) make immediate efforts to trace the payment and will notify
          you of the outcome. Subject to Section 17.2.3, unless we can prove
          that (i) the Payout was received by you via your chosen Payout Method,
          or (ii) we made the Payout correctly using the Payout Method
          information you provided but the information you provided was
          incorrect, we will refund the amount. Where you have given us
          incorrect information we will not be liable for the defective or
          non-execution of the Payout, however, we will make reasonable efforts
          to recover the Payout funds.
          <br /> 17.2.3 You must use your Credentials in accordance with these
          Payment Terms and take all reasonable steps to keep your Credentials
          safe. As a Host you may be liable for losses relating to any Diverted

          Credentials including the loss of a mobile phone on which you have
          installed the Application or where you have failed to keep your
          Credentials safe, up to a maximum of INR3000. This will not apply if
          the loss, theft or misappropriation of your Credentials was not
          detectable by you prior to the Payout, unless you acted fraudulently
          or the loss was caused by acts or omissions of Bidyourstay personnel
          or a service provider. You may, however, be liable for all losses
          relating to a Diverted Payout if we can show that you acted
          fraudulently or where, with intent or gross negligence, you failed to
          use the Bidyourstay Platform and/or Payment Services in accordance
          with the Terms or these Payment Terms (including the obligation to
          keep your Credentials safe). Except where you have acted fraudulently,
          you will not be liable for any losses incurred in respect of a
          Diverted Payout arising after notification by you of the loss, theft,
          or misappropriation of your Credentials or of the unauthorized use of
          your Credentials, where we have failed at any time to provide
          appropriate means for such notification, or where we do not require
          strong customer authentication, where required.
