      <h1>About Us</h1>

      <p>
        Homestays are a go to choice for the new age traveler as more and more
        travel enthusiasts want to experience the place they are visiting in its
        authentic self and function more independently in a care free
        environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Bidyourstay is an IIM and Google Alumnus venture that is exclusively
        trying to solve the current problems in the Homestay space.
      </p>

      <p>
        At BYS, we sit at the center of hospitality and technology and are
        trying to bring in that dialogue that has been missing in the homestay
        booking journey. Our clear and simple objective is to act as a catalyst
        for our customers who want to make a quick reservation for that
        last-minute travel plan and give them the stay of their choice at the
        price they are willing to pay. Along with that, ensure that our hosts
        a.k.a our beloved ‘Skippers’ have increased earnings and can get better
        returns for their efforts put in hosting without the hassle and to and
        fro they face on either the current online portals or offline bookings
        via brokers.

        <strong>How do we do this?</strong>
        <p>
          Bidyourstay facilitates controlled negotiations through which a
          customer and a host, in a hassle free way through a smooth flow, agree
          on a price that works for both sides and can have a win-win deal
          without going off the portal.
        </p>
      </span>

      <p>
        Our customers have been able to clock an average of 22% savings compared
        to any other online travel portal operating in this space. Our Skippers
        on the hand have seen an 18% increase in occupancy over and above their
        long standing occupancy rates, and we are just getting started.
